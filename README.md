**Project Title**
This project demonstrates a multiple linear regression model for predicting salaries based on age and years of experience.

**Overview**
This project utilizes machine learning techniques, specifically multiple linear regression, to predict salaries based on two key features: age and years of experience. The model is trained using a dataset containing information about individuals' ages, years of experience, and corresponding salaries. After preprocessing the data, including handling missing values and normalization, the model is trained and evaluated for its predictive performance. The project also includes visualization of the data and the trained model's predictions to provide insights into the relationship between the features and the target variable.
